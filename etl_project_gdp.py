#An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world
#  has recruited you. You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with creating an
#  automated script that can extract the list of all countries in order of their GDPs in billion USDs (rounded to 2 decimal places)
# , as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
#  Since IMF releases this evaluation twice a year, this code will be used by the organization to extract the
#  information as it is updated.
#You can find the required data on this webpage.
#The required information needs to be made accessible as a JSON file 'Countries_by_GDP.json' as well as a table
#  'Countries_by_GDP' in a database file 'World_Economies.db' with attributes 'Country' and 'GDP_USD_billion.'
#Your boss wants you to demonstrate the success of this code by running a query on the database table to display 
# only the entries with more than a 100 billion USD economy. Also, log the entire process of execution in a file
#  named 'etl_project_log.txt'.
#You must create a Python code 'etl_project_gdp.py' that performs all the required tasks.
